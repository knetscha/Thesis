  abstract = {We present a theory for electron self-injection in nonlinear, multidimensional
	plasma waves excited by a short laser pulse in the bubble regime
	or by a short electron beam in the blowout regime. In these regimes,
	which are typical for electron acceleration in the last impressive
	experiments, the laser radiation pressure or the electron beam charge
	pushes out plasma electrons from some region, forming a plasma cavity
	or a bubble with a huge ion charge. The plasma electrons can be trapped
	in the bubble and accelerated by the plasma wakefields up to a very
	high energy. We derive the condition of the electron trapping in
	the bubble. The developed theory predicts the trapping cross section
	in terms of the bubble radius and the bubble velocity. It is found
	that the dynamic bubble deformations observed in the three-dimensional
	(3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations influence the trapping process
	significantly. The bubble elongation reduces the gamma-factor of
	the bubble, thereby strongly enhancing self-injection. The obtained
	analytical results are in good agreement with the 3D PIC simulations.},

  abstract = {{A nonlinear kinetic theory for multidimensional plasma wave wakes
	with phase velocities near the speed of light is presented. This
	theory is appropriate for describing plasma wakes excited in the
	so-called blowout regime by either electron beams or laser pulses
	where the plasma electrons move predominantly in the transverse direction.
	The theory assumes that all electrons within a blowout radius are
	completely expelled. These radially expelled electrons form a narrow
	sheath just beyond the blowout radius which is surrounded by a region
	which responds weakly (linearly). This assumption is reasonable when
	the spot size of the electron beam and laser are substantially less
	than the blowout radius. By using this theory one can predict the
	wakefield amplitudes and blowout radius in terms of the electron
	beam or laser beam parameters, as well as predict the nonlinear modifications
	to the wake's wavelength and wave form. For the laser case, the laser
	spot size must also be properly matched in order for a narrow sheath
	to form. The requirements for forming a spherical wave form, i.e.,
	"bubble," are also discussed. The theory is also used to show when
	linear fluid theory breaks down and how this leads to a saturation
	of the logarithmic divergence in the linear Green's function. {\copyright}2006

  title = {Physics of particle trapping in ultrarelativistic plasma wakes},
  school = {College of Letters, Arts and Sciences},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {The accelerator at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is the world's
	largest linear accelerator. The electron beam produced here is unique;
	it is an ultra-relativistic, 28.5 GeV, and ultra-intense (rms bunch
	length and spot size (~ 10-50 microns) electron beam. Its radial
	field is so intense that it can field ionize and create a plasma
	as it traverses a neutral gas. It also creates a very large amplitude
	(10s of GV/m) plasma wave. When the plasma wave (wake) amplitude
	is so large, some of the plasma electrons can gain enough forward
	momentum that they might catch-up with the wave, i.e. get trapped
	in the wave. This is called wave breaking. Wave breaking has been
	of fundemental interest for many years and is important in plasma-based
	accelerators. In the SLAC experiment we observed trapping although
	1-D cold relativistic wave breaking theory predicts wave breaking
	to occur for waves with much higher amplitudes. We attribute this
	to the uniqueness of the plasma source and field ionization. The
	plasma source is a heat pipe oven where a hot Lithium (Li) gas is
	confined at the edges by a helium (He) buffer gas. The plasma wake
	traps electrons in the He-Li transition regions of the oven. The
	lithium plasma electrons support the wake, however, the higher ionization
	potential helium electrons are ionized as the beam is focused by
	the Li ions and can be trapped inside the wake with a lower wave
	amplitude.; As the wake amplitude is increased in the experiment,
	the onset of trapping is observed as a sudden increase both in the
	total number of electrons leaving the plasma and in the visible radiation
	they emit. The experimentally inferred trapping threshold is at a
	wake amplitude of 36 GV/m, and is in good agreement with predictions
	of an analytical model and detailed particle in cell simulations
	of the experiment. These electrons are measured to gain 10s of GeV
	energiesand simulations show that these electrons reach energies
	(>28.5 GeV) exceeding the electron beam driver. Experiments suggest
	and simulations show that these electrons also form ultra short (a
	few microns long) bunches. The properties of these trapped electron
	bunches if optimized can be useful for many applications such as
	high brightness radiation sources that are used to investigate the
	properties of molecules in biological cells.; In this thesis, the
	onset of trapping of electrons that are ionized inside a highly relativistic,
	three dimensional plasma wake and their properties is investigated
	with theory simulation and experiment.}
