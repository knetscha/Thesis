\subsection{The FACET experimental setup}
\subsection{Plasma glow diagnostic}
One huge advantage of the hydrogen FACET setup compared to the oven setup is that now several viewports allow for observing the interaction or \ref{Facet_setup}.

The plasma glow diagnostic is a very simple tool, that turned out to be extremely helpful in controlling the 
alignment and synchronization of the experimental setup. The main idea is to have a camera integrate over all the light from the plasma during its recombination time.
