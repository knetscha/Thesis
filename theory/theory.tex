\section{Plasma physics}
There are several definitions of a plasma, but one of the most appealing one that we will follow in this work can be found in the classic 
textbook by Francis F. Chen:
"A plasma is a quasineutral gas of charged and neutral particles which
exhibits collective behavior" \cite{Chen_book_Plasma}.
Regarding the gas types we will conveniently assume them to be electrons, ions and neutral atoms and comment that other particles as well can fit the definition of a plasma, but such exotic compositions are beyond the scope of this work.
\subsection*{Debye Shielding}
The concept of \textit{quasi-neutrality} roots in the shielding behavior of the ions and electrons of charges inside the plasma. 
A positive net charge e.g. originating from a difference in ion density $n_\mathrm{i}$ and electron density $n_\mathrm{e}$ at a temperature $T$
would attract electrons and lead to an electron distribution 
\begin{equation}
f(u) \propto \exp(-\frac{1}{2}\mE v^2+\qE/( k_\mathrm{B}T)).
\end{equation}

With the Poisson Equation 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Poisson_plasma}
\epsilon_0 \frac{d^2\Phi}{dx^2}&=-\qE(\nE-n_\mathrm{i})\\
&=\qE \nE (\exp(\qE\Phi/(k_\mathrm{B}T))-1)\\
&\approx \qE\nE(\qE\Phi/(k_\mathrm{B}T)+...)
\end{align}
we can now derive the potential in the plasma
\begin{equation}
\Phi = \Phi_0\exp(-|x|/\lambda_\mathrm{D})
\end{equation}
with the information about the range of the shielded Coulomb field embedded in the Debye Radius
\begin{equation}
\lambda_\mathrm{D}=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_0 k_\mathrm{B}T}{n_\mathrm{e}\qE^2}}.
\end{equation}
We can see that a plasma with an edge length $L>>\lambda_\mathrm{D}$ would have its Coulomb fields shielded and appear to an outside observer to be charge-neutral. 



\subsection*{Plasma frequency}
Electrons and ions in a plasma can be described as two fluids, each following the fluid dynamics and interacting via the Maxwell Equations and collisions.

If the electron fluid is displaced with respect to the ion fluid this leads to strong electric fields, acting upon both as a restoring force, but as $m_\mathrm{i}>>\mE$, the electron response is much quicker which is why these kind of plasma oscillations are dominated by the electrons, while the ions can be considered inert.

Starting from equation (\ref{eqn:Poisson_plasma}) with the relation of the electric field and its potential being $\vec{E}=-\nabla \Phi$ 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_0 \nabla \vec{E}=\qE (n_\mathrm{i}-\nE)
\end{equation}
becomes for small perturbations $n'=\nE+\delta n$
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_0 \nabla \vec{E}=\qE \delta n).
\end{equation}
The solution to this differential equation is a harmonic density oscillation 
\begin{equation}
n(x,t)=\delta n \exp(i(kx-\wP t)).
\end{equation}
The characteristic frequency of this oscillation 
\begin{equation}
\omega_\mathrm{p}=\sqrt{\frac{n_\mathrm{e}q_\mathrm{e}^2}{\epsilon_0 m_\mathrm{e}}}
\end{equation}
is called the \textit{Plasma frequency} and is one of the most important parameters in plasma physics. 
In the field of PWFA it is convenient to also consider the wavelength associated with the plasma oscillations, 
the \textit{Plasma wavelength}
\begin{equation}
\lP=2\pi\frac{\wP}{c}.
\end{equation}

Typical values for example for a plasma density $\nE=1\times10^{17}\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ are

\begin{align*}
\wP &\approx 56400 \sqrt{\nE [\mathrm{cm}^{-3}]} \approx 1.8\times10^{18}\ 1/s\\
\lP & \approx 105.6 /\sqrt{\nE [10^{17} \mathrm{cm}^{-3} ]} [\mu\mathrm{m}] = 105.6\ \mu\mathrm{m}.
\end{align*} 



It is worth noting that the Debye Shielding assumes a thermalized plasma and is not the right idea of a plasma reaction to a rapid change in charge on a femtosecond timescale. 
The more appropriate figure of merit in that case is the depth an electromagnetic wave with frequency $\omega$ can permeate the plasma fluid given by the skin depth 
\begin{equation}
\kP^{-1}=\frac{c}{\sqrt{\wP^2-\omega^2}}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{time scales}
scattering can be talked about

\subsection{plasma definition}
There are different types of plasmas, but we are only handling with thin, cold  weakly coupled plasmas
\subsection{electromagnetic waves in plasmas}
dispersion relation needs to be talked about. Especially the dispersion relation of lasers during ionization should get some insight here. One has to look into ionization defocussing.

So far everything still flows niocely with working along Chen and Mulser. However now the turn needs to be taken.
The reason is wavebreaking

\section{PWFA theory}
\subsection{History of PWFA}
A short historic overview is given. 
Maybe mention landau damping? Then of course, Tajima,Dawson. Also MTV and Rosenzweig should be mentioned.
\section{The linear regime}
Herleitung by esarey \cite{RevModPhys.81.1229}


\begin{equation}
E_\xi=4\pi \int_0^\xi \rho{\xi'}\cos(\kP(\xi-\xi'))d\xi
\end{equation}
The transformer ratio $R_\mathrm{trans}=\frac{E_\mathrm{max}^+}{E_\mathrm{max}^-} $ in PWFA is defined as
the ratio of the maximum accelerating electric field
behind the driving bunch, $E_\mathrm{max}^+$, to the maximum decelerating $E_\mathrm{max}^-$
electric field acting upon drive beam electrons. Experimentally the transformer ratio is comparably easy access-able if one assumes the acceleration length for the witness beam and deceleration length for the drive beam to be equal and that the  witness beam is in accelerated at the peak accelerating field.
Then it can be observed in the electron energy spectrum as the maximum energy gain of the witness beam divided by the maximum energy loss of the drive beam. In that sense the transformer ratio is a measure of efficiency with which the drive electron beam can transfer energy to the witness electron beam. 
In the linear regime for a Gaussian drive beam 
In \cite{PhysRevLett.56.1252} it is calculated and simulated that the transformer in the linear regime, which is otherwise limited to $R_\mathrm{trans}\leq 2$ for a symmetric drive beam current profile \cite{bane1984wake}, can reach up to $R_\mathrm{trans}\approx 6.12$ by applying a triangular shaped drive beam current.

\section{Accelerator physics}
In the previous chapters we examined the physics of the beam driven plasma wake excitation. 
The ultimate goal as presented in this work is to advantageously make use of the fields in order to inject and accelerate a high quality secondary electron beam, which is conventionally called the witness beam. If there are no substantial advantages between  using the witness over the drive beam for a given application, it might not be worth the effort beyond a scholastic interest.
In this section we will explain the basic electron beam behavior in an accelerator and from that determine the most important parameters. 
\subsection{Single particle movement}

We start with the 
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=q(\vec{E}+\frac{\vec{v}}{c}\times\vec{B})
\end{equation}

Similar to the assumptions made in par-axial optics the electron can be expected to 
follow a straight trajectory in the absence of any deflecting or accelerating force and any small change in that trajectory 
can be expressed in a number of linear changes. 
As in par-axial optics this gives the possibility to describe the electron beam trajectory with linear transformations, represented by a matrix formalism.
This idea can be extrapolated to the entire phase-space information of an electron, so that equation
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:R_Matrix}
\begin{split}
\Phi_\mathrm{f}&=\hat{R} \Phi_\mathrm{i} \\
\begin{pmatrix}
x_\mathrm{f}\\
x'_\mathrm{f}\\
y_\mathrm{f}\\
y'_\mathrm{f}\\
z_\mathrm{f}\\
\delta_\mathrm{f}\\
\end{pmatrix}
&=
\begin{pmatrix}
R_{11}&R_{12}&R_{13}&R_{14}&R_{15}&R_{16}\\
R_{21}&R_{22}&R_{23}&R_{24}&R_{25}&R_{26}\\
R_{31}&R_{32}&R_{33}&R_{34}&R_{35}&R_{36}\\
R_{41}&R_{42}&R_{43}&R_{44}&R_{45}&R_{46}\\
R_{51}&R_{52}&R_{53}&R_{54}&R_{55}&R_{56}\\
R_{61}&R_{62}&R_{63}&R_{64}&R_{65}&R_{66}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_\mathrm{i}\\
x'_\mathrm{i}\\
y_\mathrm{i}\\
y'_\mathrm{i}\\
z_\mathrm{i}\\
\delta_\mathrm{i}\\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

describes a complete linear transformation of an electron's phase space vector as a conservative force acts upon it, with the spatial components $x,y,z$, the transverse momenta $x'=\frac{p_\mathrm{x}}{p_\mathrm{z}},y'=\frac{p_\mathrm{y}}{p_\mathrm{z}}$ and the deviation  $\delta=\frac{\delta p_\mathrm{z}}{p_\mathrm{z}}$ from the design momentum $p_\mathrm{z}$
The matrix $\mathbf{R}_\mathrm{m,n}= \frac{\delta \Phi_\mathrm{n}}{\delta \Phi_\mathrm{n}}$ is the Jacobian of this transformation and as that it requires $\mathrm{det}(\hat{R})=1$.


Wiedemann:\cite{Wiedemann_accelerator}


 Jamies book: \cite{Book_Fundamentals_Rosenzweig}
\subsection{Liouville Theorem}
When now considering an entire bunch of electrons it comes in handy to describe it as a smooth phase space distribution
$f(\vec{r},\vec{p})$, which is conventionally normalized so that  
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:f_int_1}
\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}f(\vec{r},\vec{p})d\vec{r}d\vec{p}=1 .
\end{equation}

The Liouville Theorem states that if only conservative forces are applied to the bunch the total phase volume occupied by the distribution stays constant. This is mathematically equivalent to any transformation that maintains condition (\ref{eqn:f_int_1}), which can be expressed by Jacobian transformations of the kind described by equation (\ref{eqn:R_Matrix}).
Of course $\hat{R}$ does not need to act upon the entire 6D-Phase space. In fact it is common to reduce the analysis and describe only changes in the transverse phase space, the so called \textit{trace space}, as the planes are mathematically independent and often beam-optics that only influence one plane such as quadropoles or dipoles are applied.

In order to obtain a measure of the actual phase space volume the statistical moments of the distribution can be determined by evaluating the integral 
\begin{equation}
<x^n>=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\vec{r},\vec{p})x^n dx.
\end{equation}
%with the total time differentiate
%\begin{align}
%\frac{d f}{dt}&=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\sum_i \frac{dx_i}{dt}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}+\frac{dp_i}{dt}\frac{\partial f}{\partial p_i}
%&=\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}+\sum_i()
%\end{align}
\subsection{Courant-Snyder coefficients, brightness and emittance}
Courant and Snyder with their summary paper \cite{COURANT1958} have set the standard for defining the phase space volume in the trace space with an ellipse equation for its boundary
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:CourandSnyderEllipse}
\gamma <x^2>+2\alpha <x> <x'>+\beta <x'^2> =\epsilon.
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\alpha =\frac{<x^2>}{\epsilon}, \gamma=\frac{<x'^2>}{\epsilon}, \alpha=\frac{<xx'>}{\epsilon}
\end{equation}
are the so called \textit{Courant Snyder parameters} and $\epsilon$ is the trace space emittance. 
As $f(\vec{r},\vec{p})$ is considered to be smooth function, it might as well consist of a distribution that only approaches 0 so that it is difficult to draw a absolute volume edge as illustrated in figure (\ref{img:TraceSpace}).
Because of this and for the sake of simplicity in comparing the value with experimental data, it is useful to work with the rms values. So the \textit{rms trace space emittance} according to \cite{PhysRevSTAB.6.034202} is
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_\mathrm{tr,rms}=\sqrt{<x^2><x'^2>-<xx'>^2}.
\end{equation}
This can additionally be normalized to the \textit{normalized rms trace space emittance} into the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:NormTraceSpaceEmitt}
\epsilon_\mathrm{n,tr,rms}=\frac{p_\mathrm{z}}{\mE c}\sqrt{<x^2><x'^2>-<xx'>^2}
\end{equation} 
so that its value stays current during acceleration.
The emittance is an important value, as it is invariant under conservative transformations and therefore an important 
figure of merit for electron beam quality in general. 
Definition (\ref{eqn:NormTraceSpaceEmitt}) will mostly be applied in the context of this work.

\section{Electron Trapping in plasma accelerators}
%The blowout regime inherits an excellent wake field distribution to efficiently accelerate electrons due to the large accelerating fields of the order of $10^{10} \mathrm{V/m}$ and the strong focusing fields in the back of the bubble. Energy can easily be transferred from an driver bunch to a trailing witness electron bunch, which has been sucessfully shown in two-bunch experiments at SLAC. A chirped electron bunch was accelerated to 42 GeV in the linear accelerator, rotated in a magnetic chicane, where the central part of the electron beam was cut out by a collimator and rotated back so that two seperate electron bunches where trailing on the same orbit. In the subsequent plasma stage the wakefields accelerated the witness bunch to up to 84 GeV in only ??? m of acceleration. This external injection scheme was very successfull and has been further studied during the entire experimental period of FACET. With such high fields 
%Even though the fields are DAMN

In order to derive an expression for the trapping condition of a single electron in PWFA, one has to start with the equation of motion for such a single electron. 
\begin{equation}
\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=q(\vec{E}+\frac{\vec{v}}{c}\times\vec{B})
\end{equation}
with the electron charge $q$ electric field $\vec{E}$ and magnetic field $\vec{B}$

This leads to the single particle electron hamiltonian $ H=\gamma m c^2+\Phi$ with the temporal derivative.
\begin{align}
\frac{dH}{dt}&=\frac{d}{dt} (\gamma m_e c^2)+\frac{d}{dt}(q\Phi)\\
&=\vec{v}\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}+\frac{d}{dt}(q\Phi)\\
&=q\vec{v}(-\nabla \Phi-\frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t})+\frac{\vec{v}\times\vec{B}}{c}+\frac{d}{dt}(q\Phi)\\
&=q(\frac{d}{dt}\Phi-\vec{v}\vec{\nabla}\Phi-\vec{v}\frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t})\\
&=q(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t}-\vec{v}\frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t})
\end{align}

If one assumes now, that the wake fields are constant during the trapping process, then 

\begin{equation}
(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+v_\mathrm{\phi} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} ) f =   f ( z-v_\mathrm{\phi} t)
\end{equation}\begin{equation}
(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+v_\mathrm{\phi} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} ) f =0 \ \forall \   f (\vec{r}, z-v_\mathrm{\phi} t)
\end{equation}
which is especially true for the hamiltonian.
\begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}H&=q(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t}-\vec{v}\frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial t})\\
&=-q v_\mathrm{\phi}(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial z}-\vec{v} \frac{\partial \vec{A}}{\partial z}) 
\end{align*}

Since $H-v_\mathrm{\phi}P_z=\mathrm{const.}$

\begin{align}
H-v_\mathrm{\phi}P_z &= \mathrm{const.}\\
\gamma m c^2+\Psi-v_\mathrm{\phi}p_z-v_\mathrm{\phi}qA_z &= \mathrm{const.}\\
\gamma+\frac{q \Phi}{m c^2}-v_\mathrm{\phi} \frac{p_z}{mc^2} &= \mathrm{const.}\\
\gamma - v_\mathrm{\phi} \frac{p_z}{mc^2}- \underbrace{\frac{q}{mc^2}(\Phi-v_\mathrm{\phi}A_z)}_{\bar{\Psi}}  &= \mathrm{const.} 
\end{align}
$\bar{\Psi}$ is the trapping potential, that determines the potential difference for an electron in a potential that moves with a phase velocity $v_\mathrm{\phi}$ with respect to the laboratory frame. It is valid for small as for relativistic velocities.
With the trapping potential one can calculate if an electron inside the plasma wake will be accelerated or not i.e. if electrons will be able to catch up with the wake's velocity during the propagation of the wake or if it will slip out of the potential.
From the prior calculations a general formula can be determined, that compares

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Trapping_Potential_Pre}
\Delta \bar{\Psi}= \bar{\Psi}_\mathrm{i}-\bar{\Psi}_\mathrm{f}=\gamma_\mathrm{f}-\gamma_\mathrm{i}-\gamma_f\frac{v_\mathrm{\phi}v_\mathrm{f}}{c^2}+\gamma_\mathrm{i}\frac{v_\mathrm{\phi}v_\mathrm{i}}{c^2} 
\end{equation}

In order to honor the name "trapping potential" i.e. to apply this derivation to make predictions of the electron trapping behavior in the plasma wake, it is necessary to define a trapping condition. 
An obvious and conventional choice is that an electron should catch up with the wake's velocity so that 
$v_\mathrm{f}=v_\mathrm{\phi}$.
Equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Potential_Pre} consequently simplifies to 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:Trapping_Potential_Raw}
\Delta \bar{\Psi}&= \gamma_\mathrm{\phi}-\gamma_\mathrm{i}-\gamma_\mathrm{\phi}\frac{v_\mathrm{\phi}^2}{c^2}+\gamma_\mathrm{i}\frac{v_\mathrm{\phi}v_\mathrm{i}}{c^2} 
\end{align}
Equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Potential_Raw} can be further separated into different physical cases:
\subsection*{luminal wakefield, electron injected  at rest}
In this case the plasma wake travels with a phase velocity near the speed of light, which is the case for beam-driven scenarios with high $\gamma$ driver beams ($v_\mathrm{\phi} \approx c$), and electrons starting inside the wake initially at rest ($v_\mathrm{i} \approx \ 0$).
Here Equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Potential_Raw} simplifies to
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Trapping_Potential_TH}
\Delta \bar{\Psi}=-1
\end{equation}
Examples of this case are the underdense photocathode, or Trojan Horse injection\cite{Hidding_PRL_2012}, or wakefield induced ionization injection\cite{MartinezdelaOssa2014231}.

\subsection*{luminal wakefield, electron injected  with v $\neq 0$}
\begin{equation}
\Delta \bar{\Phi}= -\gamma_\mathrm{i}(1-\frac{v_\mathrm{i}v_\phi}{c^2})\approx -\gamma_\mathrm{i}(1-\frac{v_\mathrm{i}}{c})
\end{equation}
\subsection*{subluminal wakefield, electron injected at rest}

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:Trapping_Potential_DTH}
\Delta \bar{\Psi}=\gamma_\mathrm{\phi}(1-\frac{v_\mathrm{\phi}^2}{c^2})-1=\gamma_\mathrm{\phi}^{-1}-1
\end{equation}
This formula can for example be applied to ionization injection in LWFA\cite{PakPRL2012} or beam-driven ionization injection schemes in which the wake's phase velocity is retarded such as the Downramp-assisted Trojan Horse (DTH)\cite{DTH}, which this work has as special focus on. In latter case mathematically strictly speaking $\frac{d H}{dt}\neq0 $, but for small changes $\frac{dH}{dt}\approx 0$ during the injection process of the electrons, equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Potential_DTH} can still be applied.

\subsection*{superluminal wakefield}
There are physical situations imaginable in which the wake or at least part of the wake move with a phase velocity faster than the speed of light. This is the case for example when a beam driven wake traverses an electron density upramp.
From the previous deductions it seems obvious, that trapping electrons in such a superluminal wakefield is not possible, as $\gamma_\mathrm{\phi}^{-1}$ becomes complex for $v_\mathrm{\phi}>c$.

However, if the superluminosity is only transient as with a short density upramp, the phase velocity will return to $c$ right after the transition. In this case trpping can be possible, but the mathematic tool presented in this section is insufficient to describe the trapping and the phase velocity after the transition is setting the demand on the potential.
\subsection{Trapping position and bunch compression}
Assuming that the longitudinal wake field 
$\frac{\partial E_\mathrm{z}}{\partial r} = 0 $ for a sufficiently wide radius the trapping behaviour can be seen in 1D only.
In the blowout regime the acceleration gradient is to second order linear in $\xi$ (compare section \ref{sec:Blowout_regime}) with
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:linear_blowout_Ez_raw}
E_\mathrm{z}(\xi)=\tilde{E_0}\xi.
\end{equation}
One should keep in mind that the origin of the coordinate system has been shifted so that $\xi=0$ is at the zero-crossing of the electric field. $\tilde{E_0}$ is the slope of the accelerating field. This will be filled with values later on, but for now we are just interested in a more general derivation. Additionally equation \ref{eqn:linear_blowout_Ez_raw} is only valid within the boundaries $[-\lP/2,\lP/2]$.
Integrating erquation \ref{eqn:linear_blowout_Ez_raw} gives the potential
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:linear_blowout_Pot_raw}
U_\mathrm{z}(\xi)=\frac{1}{2}\tilde{E_0}\xi^2.
\end{equation}
Now equation \ref{eqn:linear_blowout_Pot_raw} is inserted in equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Potential_TH} and rearranged in order to find for an electron released at an inital position $\xi_\mathrm{i}$ its trapping position $\xi_\mathrm{f}$ by deriving
\begin{align}
\bar{\Psi}_\mathrm{f}-\bar{\Psi}_\mathrm{i}&=-1\\
U_\mathrm{z}(\xi_\mathrm{f})-U_\mathrm{z}(\xi_\mathrm{i})&=-\frac{\mE c^2}{\qE}\\
(\xi_\mathrm{i}^2-\xi_\mathrm{f}^2)&=-\underbrace{\frac{2\mE c^2}{\hat{E_0}\qE}}_{\alpha_\mathrm{t}}\\
\label{eqn:Trapping_Position}
\xi_\mathrm{f}&=\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{i}^2+\alpha_\mathrm{t}}.
\end{align}

Equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Position} is now the relation between release and trapping position of an electron in the co-moving frame for an accelerating field approximated to be linear. 
Forthgoing with our calculation we would like to handle a distribution of electrons to get closer to the description of the witness electron beam.
This finding can than be used to calculate the compression of a released electron beam during the trapping.
For that we start with a 1D spatial Gaussian distribution  with rms length $\sigma_\xi$. We will later see that this assumption in fact resembles very well the distribution of interest.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:xi_init_dist}
f(\xi)=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(\xi+\delta \xi)^2}{2\sigma_\xi^2}}.
\end{equation}
The distribution should be normalized to
\begin{equation}
\int \limits_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\xi)d\xi\stackrel{!}{=}1.
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eqn:xi_init_dist} is now the initial injected electron beam and can, by applying equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Position} be used to calculate the trapped electron beam distribution.

\begin{align}
f_\mathrm{f}(\xi)&=f(\xi_\mathrm{f}(\xi_\mathrm{i}))\frac{\partial \xi_\mathrm{i}}{\partial \xi_\mathrm{f}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}})^2}{2\sigma_\xi^2}} \frac{\xi_\mathrm{i}}{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{i}^2+\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}{2\sigma_\xi^2}} \frac{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}{\sqrt{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}^2+\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}{2\sigma_\xi^2}} \frac{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}+\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}{2\sigma_\xi^2}} \frac{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}+\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}{2\sigma_\xi^2}} \frac{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2}}\\
&=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}{2\sigma_\xi^2}} \frac{\sqrt{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}}{\xi_\mathrm{f}}\\
\label{eqn:Trapping_Response_function}
&=\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi \sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2-\alpha_\mathrm{t}}{2\sigma_\xi^2}} 
\sqrt{1-\frac{\alpha_\mathrm{t}}{\xi_\mathrm{f}^2}}\\
\end{align} 
One should note here, that equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Response_function} as well as equation \ref{eqn:xi_init_dist} offer positive as well as negative solutions due to the symmetry of the potential. Causality and the physics of accelerators does of course only allow solutions with $\xi_\mathrm{f}<0$. Since we assume that no charge is lost or created during trapping for $f_f(\xi)$ as well a normalization so that
\begin{equation}
\int \limits_{-\infty}^{0} f_f(\xi)d\xi\stackrel{!}{=}1
\end{equation}
is required.

Equation \ref{eqn:Trapping_Response_function} can be seen a response function to an electron release.

\subsubsection{emittance preservation}
why don't you ... look at space charge effect to estimate required gamma/acceleration and focusing forces for emittance preservation ? Try looking at Pak's thesis and this emittance paper that claims one needs a fast acceleration, but knows nothing about Trojan Horse yet.
\section{Acceleration methods in PWFA}
The strong accelrating fields in PWFA can be harvested with a variety of methods. They differ in experimental complexity, demand towards drive beam 



\subsection{External injection - Double bunch}
External injection is the least complex PWFA setup and is also the method that has been demonstrated much earlier than other methods. The basic idea is that a plasma wake is set up by an electron beam, electrons - either from the same electron beam or by a trailing electron beam - are accelerated, if they are at the right phase with respect to the wake.

The first experimental realization of a PWFA was established in 1988 at the Argonne advanced accelerator test facility (AATF)\cite{rosenzweig1988experimental}. With a method successfully applied to measure the wake fields in accelerating structures
a $2-3\ \mathrm{nC}$ electron beam with a rms bunch length of $2.4 \mathrm{mm}$ was used to drive a wake in a $33\ \mathrm{cm} $ long plasma at a density of the order of $ 10^{13}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. The driving bunch was trailed by a low-charge witness beam with variable delay to scan the wake fields.
The oscillating nature of the wake fields was well measured with a maximum accelerating gradient of $1.6\ \mathrm{MeV/m}$. 
With a higher driver witness beam charge of $4\ \mathrm{nC}$ \cite{figueroa1988direct} it was possible to show a non-linear wake with an accelerating gradient of $5.3\ \mathrm{MeV/m}$. 

In 2006 at the Final Focus Test Beam Facility (FFTB) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) the blow-out regime was finally reached as described in \cite{blumenfeld2007energyDoubling}.
A $42\ \mathrm{GeV}$ electron beam with a spot size of $10\ \mathrm{\mu m}$ and rms bunch length of $~15\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ propagated through a $85\ \mathrm{cm}$ Li oven. The shorter, high current bunch now allowed for driving a wake in a much higher plasma density of $2.7\times 10^{17}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3} $ in the blowout regime. Thanks to the extremely high wake field gradient of $52\ \mathrm{GeV/m}$ which effectively accelerated part of the electron beam to up to $85\ \mathrm{GeV}$.

The successor experiment to the plasma experiments at the FFTB is the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests (FACET)\cite{clarke2012facet}. Several double-bunch experiments have been successfully conducted.  
At FACET the double-bunches are produced by accelerating one long electron bunch all the way to the final chicane. 
While the chirped bunch is dispersed, the central part is cut out by a mask which results in a scrape in the current profile  \cite{hogan2010FACET}. This method has the advantage that the transport of the beam along the LINAC is only required for one bunch.
Efficiency and beamloading effects were studied in \cite{litos2014high} and recently at FACET a double-bunch acceleration of positrons in a positron-driven wake was demonstrated by shaping the transverse plasma shape to a hollow channel, which effectively avoids any transverse fields that would otherwise defocus the positrons \cite{ThesisGessner}.
